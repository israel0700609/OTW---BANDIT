# OverTheWire: Bandit ‚Äì Linux & Security Wargame


This repository documents my journey through the **Bandit** wargame on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), a series of beginner-friendly Linux and security challenges.

## üéØ What is Bandit?

**Bandit** is a hands-on wargame designed to teach core Linux skills, file manipulation, networking, and basic infosec techniques. Each level presents a small challenge that requires logical thinking, persistence, and command-line proficiency.

## üí° What I Learned

Throughout the game, I strengthened my understanding of:

- **Shell navigation** and working in restricted environments
- Using tools like `ssh`, `scp`, `nc`, `telnet` to access remote resources
- Inspecting file types (`file`, `xxd`, `strings`, `hexdump`)
- Searching and filtering data with `grep`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `awk`
- Understanding Linux file permissions and `setuid` binaries
- Working with Git: `clone`, `log`, `checkout`, `branches`, `tags`
- Thinking outside the box and debugging creatively

## üß† Focus on Process, Not Answers

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository **does not** include any passwords or step-by-step solutions.

Out of respect for the creators and the learning experience, I have chosen **not to post any spoilers**. Instead, this repo highlights the concepts and tools I encountered, with the goal of inspiring others to try the challenges themselves.
